Generic script for creating templates using keys that will be replaced in your template.
This script can be used to speed up work that is repeated over and over again. For example when I write a plugin for a given project, I always copy an existing project rename the classes
change the UUIDs and the file names inside the project file and couple of other things. It takes up a couple of hours, since I have to check multiple times if I changed everything correctly.
This script should do that from now on.
